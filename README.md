# DjangoApps is a portfolio of demo applications I created as I was learning to use the Django framework. Two of these are more fleshed-out: Naga, a D&D character sheet application which hosts my personal character sheets, and Music, a website which displays and promotes my work as a professional flutist. I have also since added some React apps which use the Django backend - the better of these is Eau du Jour, a perfume app.
