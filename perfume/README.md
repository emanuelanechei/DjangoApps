A React app to help me quickly select today's perfume!

For more practice in React, I created an app which will help me select what perfume to wear today.
I have 30+ perfumes (in small sizes, don't judge me!) and love to rotate scents every day. I'd been asking my partner for a random number to select which one to wear, but I built this to be a little more robust!
Supports selecting a random perfume or browsing perfumes by category (categorization by me).
